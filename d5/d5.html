<h3>What are CSS combinators </h3>
<p>CSS combinators are explaining the relationship between two selectors. CSS selectors are the patterns used to select the elements for style purpose. A CSS selector can be a simple selector or a complex selector consisting of more than one selector connected using combinators.<br> 
    There are four types of combinators available in CSS which are discussed below:<br> 
    General Sibling selector (~)<br>
    Adjacent Sibling selector (+)<br>
    Child selector (>)<br>
    Descendant selector (space)<br>
</p>
<h3>What are pseudo selectors in CSS</h3>
<p>A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.<br>
    For example, it can be used to:<br>
    Style an element when a user mouses over it<br>
    Style visited and unvisited links differently<br>
    Style an element when it gets focus</p>
